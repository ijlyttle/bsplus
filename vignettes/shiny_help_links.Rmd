Let's consider a **shiny** input. One way to put unobtrusive help into a **shiny** input is to embed a help icon into its label, having associated the help icon with the help documentation. This suggests three steps:

1. Create a help icon. You can use `shiny::icon()` or `shiny_iconlink()` (which simply wraps the icon in an HTML link).
1. Associate the help icon with your help documentation. Here, you can use `bs_embed_tooltip()`, `bs_embed_popover()` or `bs_attach_modal()`.
1. Embed your help icon into the **shiny** input. You can use `shinyInput_label_embed()`.

Here's an example of everything put together:

```{r eval = FALSE}
selectInput(
  inputId = "letter",
  label = "Label with popover help",
  choices = c("a", "b", "c")
) %>%
shinyInput_label_embed(
  shiny_iconlink() %>%
  bs_embed_popover(
    title = "Letter", content = "Choose a favorite", placement = "left"
  )
)
```

As of writing, I don't know how to include operable **shiny** inputs in an html document, outside of the **shiny** runtime. To see these functions in action, you can refer to this [**shiny** app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tooltip_popover_modal/#), which you can also run locally using:

```R
shiny::runApp(system.file("shiny", "tooltip_popover_modal", package = "bsplus"))
```

To promote consistency, the following convention is proposed:

- For links (activated by clicking), embed a `shiny::icon("info-circle")`, the default for `shiny_iconlink()`. 
- For elements activated by hovering, embed a `shiny::icon("info")`.
