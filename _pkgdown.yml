  desc: >
    All of these functions deal with collapsible elements. The foundation
    is the collapse element; upon this, you can build a set of accordion panels.
    For **shiny** apps, the accordion-sidebar framework may be useful as it can
    give you another dimension with which to organize your UI.

    The verb *attach* is used with collapse elements; you create a collapse element,
    then *attach* its `id` to a link or button tag. For accordions and accordion
    sidebars, you create the framework tag, then *append* elements using the pipe.

    Also, accordion-sidebars require activation, which you can do by calling
    `use_bs_accordion_sidebar()` once on your page.

  desc: >
    Tooltips, popovers, and modals can be useful for including extra information
    in your **rmarkdown** document or your **shiny** app.

    - Modal window

    You can see tooltips, popovers, and modal windows in this
    [**shiny** app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tooltip_popover_modal).

    Different verbs are associated with these elements: you *embed* tooltips
    and popovers into tags; whereas you create a modal element, then
    *attach* its `id` to a tag.

    Also, tooltips and popovers require activation, which you can do calling
    `use_bs_tooltip()` or `use_bs_popover()` once on your page.

    One of the more-specific goals of this package is to make it easier to
    incorporate help-documentation into your **shiny** apps. Some helper
    functions are provided to create help-links, then embed them into labels
    of **shiny** inputs.

    You can see these helper functions in action in this
    [**shiny** app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tooltip_popover_modal/).

    Finally, there are some other helper functions for setting the attributes
    of tags, and to render markdown into HTML. I am looking forward to
    replacing the `render_html_fragment()` function with `markdown_html()` from
    the **commonmark** package, as soon as I can see a way to take care of
    MathJax.

    The function `bs_set_data()` makes things a little easier for you by
    prepending `"data-"` to each name and serializing values to the format
    specified by the Bootstrap API. The function `bs_set_aria()` works
    similarly to prepend `"aria-"` to each name.
