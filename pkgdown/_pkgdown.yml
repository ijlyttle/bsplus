      It may be useful to wrap a few Bootstrap components:

        - Button: [Boostrap reference](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons)

        - Panels: [Boostrap reference](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#panels)

      These components will be wrapped in a future version:

        - Wells: [Boostrap reference](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#wells)

        - Responsive Embed: [Boostrap reference](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-embed)

  - title: "Collapse, accordion, and accordion sidebar"
    desc: >
      All of these functions deal with collapsible elements. The foundation
      is the collapse element; upon this, you can build a set of accordion panels.
      For **shiny** apps, the accordion-sidebar framework may be useful as it can
      give you another dimension with which to organize your UI.

      The verb *attach* is used with collapse elements; you create a collapse element,
      then *attach* its `id` to a link or button tag. For accordions and accordion
      sidebars, you create the framework tag, then *append* elements using the pipe.

      Also, accordion-sidebars require activation, which you can do by calling
      `use_bs_accordion_sidebar()` once on your page.

      Tooltips, popovers, and modals can be useful for including extra information
      in your **rmarkdown** document or your **shiny** app.

      You can see tooltips, popovers, and modal windows in this
      [**shiny** app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tooltip_popover_modal).

      Different verbs are associated with these elements: you *embed* tooltips
      and popovers into tags; whereas you create a modal element, then
      *attach* its `id` to a tag.

      Also, tooltips and popovers require activation, which you can do calling
      `use_bs_tooltip()` or `use_bs_popover()` once on your page.

  - title: "Carousel"
    desc: >
      Carousels are used to contain sets of "content", while showing one element
      of the set at a time. Generally, the content are images, but it can be any HTML.
      One way that a this could be a more-useful tool if an “easy” way can be found
      to populate a carousel with images produced by **gganimate**.

      One of the more-specific goals of this package is to make it easier to
      incorporate help-documentation into your **shiny** apps. Some helper
      functions are provided to create help-links, then embed them into labels
      of **shiny** inputs.

      You can see these helper functions in action in this
      [**shiny** app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tooltip_popover_modal/).

      The function `bs_set_data()` makes things a little easier for you by
      prepending `"data-"` to each name and serializing values to the format
      specified by the Bootstrap API. The function `bs_set_aria()` works
      similarly to prepend `"aria-"` to each name.
